# Lesson on Variables in Python

# Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program.
# In Python, you don't need to declare the type of variable, you just assign a value to it.

# Example of different types of variables:

# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)

# Float
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height)

# String
name = "John Doe"
print("Name:", name)

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("Is Student:", is_student)

# You can also change the value of a variable after it has been assigned
age = 26
print("New Age:", age)

# Variables can be used in expressions
years_to_graduate = 4
graduation_age = age + years_to_graduate
print("Graduation Age:", graduation_age)

# You can also assign multiple variables in one line
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
print("x:", x, "y:", y, "z:", z)

a,b,c,= 4,5,6
print("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c)

# Variables can be reassigned to different types
x = "Now I'm a string"
print("x:", x)

# Remember, variable names should be descriptive and follow the naming conventions
# They should start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
# Examples of valid variable names: my_variable, variable1, _variable
# Examples of invalid variable names: 1variable, variable-name

# That's it for the basics of variables in Python!
